## Finance Calculator  

## Project Details:

### Description

The 'Finance Calculator' project is a program written in Python that was created to fulfill the level 1 compulsory task requirements as set in the Hyperion Development Software Engineering Bootcamp
that I am enrolled in. This program was designed for use by a small financial company, to allow them access to two different financial calculators namely; an investment calculator and a 
home loan repayment calculator.

### Functionality

When run, this program firstly displays a menu to the user with two options of finance calculators they can access (i.e. investment calculator or bond/ home loan repayment calculator). 
Depending on which calculator the user chooses, the program will then prompt the user for input with a series of questions, which will capture the information needed to calculate either their total investment value over a certain number of years, or their monthly bond repayments for a set time period. 
For example, if the user chooses the investment calculator, they will be asked to enter the initial deposit amount, interest rate, number of years they plan to invest for, as well as whether they wish to invest with simple or compound interest.
The program will then calculate the final investment value based on the user's input and display the results in an easy-to-read, informative sentence.
The same process is followed if the user chooses the home loan repayment calculator except that they will be asked for relevant input to calculate their monthly bond repayments (i.e. house value, interest rate and number of months planned to repay the bond).

### Usefulness

This program is useful because it displays a relatively simple, straighforward Python program that can get user input and calculate their desired option for output in an efficient, clear manner.
The code is also well commented on so that anyone running or reading the program can follow and understand each step of the process.

### How can I use it?
* Firstly, you need to clone this repository with the Task Manager program and related text files to a local repository on your computer, so that you can access and run the program.
If you need help, follow the instructions as set out github help webpage: 

  * https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository

* In order to run this program, you will then need to download the Python interpreter program onto your computer's operating system (OS) so that the Finance Calculator program can be executed.
Navigate to the following website address to download Python on your OS (e.g. Windows, Mac, Linux etc.):
  
  * https://www.python.org/downloads/

* Once you have downloaded Python, you will need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which is basically a place where you can view and run the code from. 
Python comes with a built-in IDE which you can access by opening the IDLE file from the program files that downloaded automatically with the Python interpreter.
* When opened, the IDLE python file will display a Python 'shell' window. From this window, you can now click on 'file' and then 'open' from the toolbar at the top of the window, to navigate to the Finance Calculator program and open it.
Once opened, you will be able to view the program code in another file window that will automatically open separately to the Python 'shell'. 
* When you are ready to run it, you can select 'run' from the top toolbar and then interact with the output displayed in the Python shell window. 
That is where you will be prompted to enter information from your keyboard to choose a calculator and then input the necessary details for calculation.

### Contributors

This project was worked on individually by myself as a student in the software engineering bootcamp. However, it has been reviewed and commented on by the helpful mentors from Hyperion Development!
